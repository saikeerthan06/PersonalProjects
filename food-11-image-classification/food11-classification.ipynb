    "The four different models which will be trained are: \n",
    "1. ResNet - Residual Connections allow for deeper network training without vanishing gradients. \n",
    "2. EfficientNet - Scaled width, depth and resolution in a balanced way\n",
    "3. DenseNet - Dense connections encourage feature reuse\n",
    "4. MobileNetV3 Small - Benefits from color/texture cues"
